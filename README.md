# Randomizer
This application composes a random stack of frameworks and languages to use for my YouTube projects. 

## Live Demo
Try it for yourself here:

## Idea

The idea is to have a random stack to work with for a given project. Some of them will be completely new to me :scream:, while others familiar.

The point is to grow and to experiment with you guys new technologies :satisfied:

## UI

The UI interface will be quite simple presenting four lists of concepts for:
- database 
- backend
- frontend
- UI

And a **Randomize** button which will pick a random item from each one of these lists and create a stack with them 

## Stack

I will be creating an Angular client with Material design, Firebase for the storage, no backend and hosted with GitHub Pages.
